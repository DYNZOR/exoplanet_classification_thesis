# Exoplanet Transit Detection using Deep Neural Networks

My master's dissertation project that focuses on the use deep neural networks for the detection of exoplanets in orbit of stars in the Milky Way. MLP, CNN and LSTM networks are optimized to recognise light curve patterns in the photometric time-series data to determine whether a transit signal is indeed caused by a real transiting planet, or a false positive such as an eclipsing binary star.
The data used for this project originated from NASA's Kepler telescope survey, and was retrieved from from the NASA Exoplanet Archive
