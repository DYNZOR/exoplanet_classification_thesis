# Exoplanet Transit Detection using Deep Neural Networks

MSc dissertation project that focuses on the use of deep neural networks for the detection of exoplanets in orbit of stars in the Milky Way. MLP, CNN and LSTM networks were built and optimized to recognise light curve patterns in the photometric time-series data to determine whether a transit signal is indeed caused by a real transiting planet, or a false positive such as an eclipsing binary star.
The data used for this project was produced by NASA's Kepler telescope survey, and was retrieved from the NASA Exoplanet Archive. 

To get a more in depth understanding of the work behind this project, consult my MSc dissertation [here]() and the papers in the credits section below. 

For a shorter summary, a powerpoint presentation was also prepared ->
